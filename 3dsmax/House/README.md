# House – 3ds Max Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the 3D modeling of a residential house using Autodesk 3ds Max, with an emphasis on clean geometry and UV mapping for real-time rendering workflows.

The model was created in 3ds Max and later imported into Unreal Engine, where materials were applied.

---

## Objectives
- Model a complete residential house in 3D
- Create clean and structured geometry
- Unwrap UVs to prepare the model for texturing
- Prepare assets for integration into a real-time engine

---

## Tools & Workflow
- **Autodesk 3ds Max** – modeling and UV mapping
- **Unreal Engine** – material setup and real-time visualization

---

## Project Context
This project demonstrates a complete 3D asset pipeline from modeling and UV preparation to real-time integration in Unreal Engine, highlighting best practices for real-time rendering workflows.
